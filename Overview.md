# Indian classical Music #

Indian classical Music is primarily divided in two parts - Carnatic (or South Indian) and Hindustani (or North Indian) classical music. The central notions of both these systems is that of a melodic mode or raga, sung to a rhythmic cycle or tala.

# Footnotes #

  1. The indian scale doesn't correspond exactly to the western scale in two major ways - (1) Even in two of each of the twelve notes, there are subordinate notes known as Srutis. (2) If the fundamental frequency (say C in western or S in indian) is kept the same, the other frequencies won't match exactly. Complexity (1) is not required for our initial stages. Since we are not dealing with frequencies directly, but the transliteration we need not worry about (2).
